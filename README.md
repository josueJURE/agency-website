# ejproject1 – A Superhero Agnecy for FAC Project 1 by Josué Jure and Emily Turner

## Desrciption

Conforming to the requirements of [this assignment](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/foundation/markup/project/), we decided to have a bit of fun and create an agency of superheros for hire ready to save the day. The website, built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript is easily navigable, fully accessible, mobile adapted, and stylistically consistent.  

## Technical elements

- a navigation menu, fixed at the top, that allows users to navigate between the three pages
- a javascript and css image carousel allowing users to browse images of our "team" of superheroes
- profiles of each team member styled in a flexbox layout complete with links to outside information
- a styled HTML form which allows users to submit required information and receive a message of completion (please note, this form does not currently have a backend)

## Accessibility Elements

- navigable for keyboard and voice control users via semantic HTML
- visually accessible including high colour contrast, alt text, and clear styling
